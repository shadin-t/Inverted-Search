# Inverted Search Engine

This project implements an efficient inverted search engine using C. It scans a collection of text files, indexes each word using a hash table, and allows fast lookups to determine which file(s) contain a given word.

Developed as part of a data structures module during my embedded systems training at Emertxe.

## Features

- Indexes words across multiple text files
- Supports fast word-based search
- Uses hash table with chaining for efficient lookup
- Maintains case-insensitive word storage
- Dynamic file handling with user input
- Menu-driven command-line interface

## Technologies Used

- C Programming
- Hash Tables and Linked Lists
- File I/O (fopen, fread, etc.)
- Data Structure Design
- GCC Compiler (Linux)


## Learning Outcomes

- Applied hash tables for practical text search applications
- Improved command-line tool development in C
- Strengthened skills in parsing, file handling, and dynamic memory management
